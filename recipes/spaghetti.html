    <p>Spaghetti is a dish of boiled noodles, tomato sauce, meat, and cheese.</p>
    <h4>INGREDIAANEMENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more for the pasta water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving :)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion and mince 3 garlic cloves. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, garlic, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, if using. Cook, breaking the beef up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour in 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes and season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer uncovered until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 1 pound dried spaghetti and cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions for al dente, about 9 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Return the pasta to the pot. Add the sauce, reserved pasta cooking water, and 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, and toss to combine. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, tossing continuously, until the sauce coats the pasta and everything is evenly combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve in bowls topped with lots of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>NOTES</h4>
    <p><strong>Make ahead: </strong>The sauce, without the pasta water, can be made a day in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Alternatively, it can be frozen for up to 3 months. Let the sauce thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Rewarm the sauce in a saucepan over medium heat while you cook the pasta.</p>
    <p><strong>Storage: </strong>Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>
